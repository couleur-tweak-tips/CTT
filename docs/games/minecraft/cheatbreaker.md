* Toggle Mod Keybind (useful for quickly toggling Chat, Armor HUD and Scoreboard depending on the gamemode you're playing)
* Strip the mod labels to only show the numbers (e.g for FPS and potion effects)
* Disable first person fire (in Pack Tweaks mod)

You can have 1.8's "minimum FPS" option for your FPS mod in 1.7.10
