### Lunar mods performance impact

_if you have a mod that has no purpose why even bother using it_ - Tellinq 

* 🟢 Freelook - No impact leaving it enabled
* 🟢 FPS
* 🟢 CPS
* 🟢 Saturation
* 🟢 Potion effects
* 🟢 Toggle sprint/sneak - *make sure to disable hud text if you don't use it*
* 🟢 Pack Display
* 🟢 3D Skins - *surprisingly lightweights*
* 🟡 Armor Status
* 🟡 Custom crosshair
* 🟡 ReplayMod
* 🟡 Coordinates
* 🟡 Keystrokes
* 🟡 Custom sky
* 🟠 Chat (not the mod, talking about enabling/disabling it completely)
* 🟠 Scoreboard
* 🟠 Net graph
* 🟠 Name tags (not the mod, talking about toggling on/off name plates completely)
* 🔴 Cooldowns
* 🔴 Motion blur - (because you need  to turn off `Fast Render` to make it work)
* 🔴 Fancy direction 

*(Only I tested this in 1.7.10, I'd appreciate some testing from others, let me know in DMs)*
