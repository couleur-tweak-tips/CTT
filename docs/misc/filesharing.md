In the context of sharing videos, the advantage over YouTube and other social media is that they don't compress your video (it's a <u>file</u> host, it doesn't alter it), so you don't need to upscale and wait. Perfect for sharing render tests / HQ versions of your montages

## Quirks explained:

`No embed`

: The site does not provide hotlinks / direct download links, this means linking it in Telegram / Discord won't provide you with a video player

`Video player`

: The site features a video player, allowing you to play the video without needing to download the entire file (e.g movies)

`Ran by individual`

: The site is not owned by a company, most likely a nice person hosting this for free.

`Pomf`

:   Site is powered by [Pomf](https://github.com/pomf/pomf) file host
