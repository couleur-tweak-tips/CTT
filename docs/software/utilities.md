## Disk mapping programs

These let you get a visual overview of all the files on your disk / a specified folder path, with each file's size affecting how much space it takes on the map.

Some of them let you add include/exclude patterns (e.g. to see how space do the mod jars take across all your Prism Launcher instances :)

* [WizTree](https://www.diskanalyzer.com/) - Best overall
* [SpaceSniffer](http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/index.html) - Has a detail slider, briefly highlights when a file is modified (HTTP-non-s website âš )
* [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net) - Most known, has the slowest scanning

* [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/)

## Compression/Archival programs

Ever encountered a .7z or .rar when downloading stuff?

* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) - can extract pretty much anything out there, fast
    * [NanaZip](https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip) - 7-Zip UI redesign, has Dark mode

## Directory Opus

A file explorer for power users

* PAID: 90 AUD, that's 55 USD / 50 EUR, 30 day trial (60 day registered)
* :material-web: [gptsoft.com.au](https://www.gpsoft.com.au/)

It has these notable features:

* Unlike File Explorer, you can paste in path with quotes and forward slashes

* It's snappy

* full scripting interface, including scriptable dialogs
