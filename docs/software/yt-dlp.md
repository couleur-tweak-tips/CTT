## :material-lightbulb-on: Usage

### Video

Just use `yt-dlp <url>` and it'll download whatever it considers to be best quality and audio

### Video (from point A to B)

Feel free to suggest a better way I'm just dumping this here, mind replacing `<url>` in there.

```
yt-dlp --external-downloader aria2c --external-downloader-args "-x 16 -s 16" --download-archive archive.txt <url> --no-overwrites --no-post-overwrites --no-continue --output "%(title)s.%(ext)s" --postprocessor-args "-ss 00:00:45 -to 00:03:55"
```

### Audio

Get your desired Youtube video or playlist you want to rip audio from, and then execute

`yt-dlp -f 251 -x [playlist or video]`

Where instead of the brackets, you insert your link. Here is a breakdown of the options:

+ `-f 251` selects the 251 option, which is the Opus codec for YouTube
+ `-x` specifies to only extract the audio from the link, not the video

!!! warning "iTunes users"
    If you are planning on importing audio to your Iphone through Itunes, "Opus" is not supported. You must convert the file into mp3 or AAC for it to be imported correctly.
