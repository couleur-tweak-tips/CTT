# :obs-audio: Audio


## Configuring multiple audio tracks

There's three types of audio to capture:

* Microphone / webcams: sound you produce by speaking
* Desktop audio: mix of all audio sources from apps
* Application audio capture [BETA]: Lets you have audio sources per program, which you can then use with multiple audio tracks to separately modify them in your video editor.
