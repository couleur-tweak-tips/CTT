!!! info "All the keybinds on this page are what I've set, <u>OBS has no default keybinds</u>"

If you put the same keybind on a start X and stop X / enable X and disable X it will work like a toggle.



* `Enable Preview` & `Disable Preview`: <kbd>CTRL+ENTER</kbd>

:   This may help with performance, I like to disable it after starting recording.

* `Reset Stats`: <kbd>CTRL+SHIFT</kbd>

:   very underrated, when alt-tabbing there's always a few frames that drop, I like to reset it so I can check if it's above 0, instead of trying to remember how much there was before. 


## Replay Buffer

* `Save Replay`: None by default

:   If you want to save clips with the [Replay Buffer](./output.md) without having to alt tab and click on the little :material-download: button next to <kbd>Stop Replay Buffer</kbd>
