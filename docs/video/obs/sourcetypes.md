# Source types


=== "Windows"

    ## :obs-gamepad: [Game Capture](https://obsproject.com/kb/game-capture-source)

    Captures a windows' content, most preferable as it performs best

=== "Linux"

    There's a few alternatives sources for Linux, though none are as good as Game capture on Windows

    * <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/obs-nvfbc-high-fps-git> (read pinned comments)
    * <https://github.com/nowrep/obs-vkcapture> (see [#usage](https://github.com/nowrep/obs-vkcapture?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) at the bottom of the page)

## :obs-window: [Window Capture](https://obsproject.com/kb/window-capture-sources)

This can also capture the title bar, if game capture is not available / broken, use it instead

## :obs-video: [Display Capture](https://obsproject.com/kb/display-capture-sources)

Capture what a monitor shows, least performant.
